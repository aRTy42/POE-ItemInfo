	Custom macro main file. Don't delete it. Using and including this file is important. If you don't want to edit the 
	technical AdditionalMacro.txt file, you need this file and the already defined hotkey label. 
	Epsecially if you want to execute any personal code outside of hotkey labels.
	
	**TLDR**:
		You can add your own code below, use the existing Label.
		View a formatted description/how to here -> https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro/wiki/Custom-Macros.
