[General]

; Set to 1 to make it so the script does nothing if Path of Exile window isn't the frontmost.
; If 0, the script also works if PoE isn't frontmost. This is handy for have the script parse
; textual item representations appearing somewhere else, like in the forums or text files. 
OnlyActiveIfPOEIsFront=1

; Put result text on clipboard (overwriting the textual representation the game put there to begin with)
PutResultsOnClipboard=0
ShowUpdateNotifications =1
UpdateSkipSelection =0
UpdateSkipBackup =0

[Display]
; Show item level and the item type's base level (enabled by default change to 0 to disable)
ShowItemLevel=1

; Show the max sockets based on ilvl and type
ShowMaxSockets=1

; Show damage projections (for weapons only)
ShowDamageCalculations=1

; Convert the value of currency items into chaos orbs. 
; This is based on the rates defined in <datadir>\CurrencyRates.txt
; You should edit this file with the current currency rates.
ShowCurrencyValueInChaos=1

[DisplayAffixes]

; Show total affix statistics
ShowAffixTotals=1

; Show detailed info about affixes
ShowAffixDetails=1

; Show a copy of the affix line in question when showing affix details. 
;
; For example, would display "Prefix, 5-250" instead of "+246 to Accuracy Rating, Prefix, 5-250". 
; Since the affixes are processed in order one can attribute which is which to the ordering of 
; the lines in the tooltip to the item data in game.
MirrorAffixLines=1

; Show item level of the affix 
ShowAffixLevel=1

; Show range for the affix' bracket as is on the item
ShowAffixBracket=1

; Show max possible bracket for an affix based on the item's item level
ShowAffixMaxPossible=1

; When showing max possible, don't just show the highest possible affix bracket 
; but construct a pseudo range which spans the lower bound of the lowest possible 
; bracket to the upper bound of the highest possible one. 
;
; This is usually what you want to see when evaluating an item's worth. The exception 
; being when you want to reroll an affix to the highest possible value within it's
; current bracket - then you need to see the affix range that is actually on the item 
; right now.
MaxSpanStartingFromFirst=1

; Show a T# indicator of the tier the affix bracket is in. 
; T1 being the highest possible, T2 second-to-highest and so on
ShowAffixBracketTier=1

; Appends the total number of tiers for a given affix in parentheses T/#Total
; T4/8 would represent the fourth highest tier, in eight total tiers.
ShowAffixBracketTierTotal=0

; When determining the affix bracket tier, take item level into consideration.
; However, this also means that the lower the item level the less the diversity
; of possible affix tiers since there aren't as many possibilities. This will 
; give the illusion that a low level item might be really, really good when it 
; has all T1 but in reality it can only have T1 since it's item level is so low
; it can only ever take the first bracket. 
; 
; If this option is set to 0, the tiers will always display relative to the full
; range of tiers available, ignoring the item level.
TierRelativeToItemLevel=0

; Appends info about DarkShrine effects of affixes to rares   
ShowDarkShrineInfo=0

[DisplayResults]

; Show double ranges as "1-172" instead of "1-8 to 160-172"
CompactDoubleRanges=1

; Use compact affix type designations: Suffix = S, Prefix = P, Comp. Suffix = CS, Comp. Prefix = CP
CompactAffixTypes=1

; Mirrored affix line width. Set to a number above 0 to truncate (or pad) to this many characters.
; Appends AffixDetailEllipsis when truncating.
MirrorLineFieldWidth=18

; Width of field that displays the affix' value range(s). Set to a number larger than 0 to truncate (or pad) to this many characters. 
;
; Keep in mind that there are sometimes double ranges to be displayed. Like for example on an axe, implicit physical damage might
; have a lower bound range and a upper bound range. In this case the lower bound range can have at most a 3 digit minimum value,
; and at most a 3 digit maximum value. To then display just the lower bound (which constitutes one value range field), you would need
; at least 7 characters (ex: 132-179). To complete the example here is how it would look like with 2 fields (lower and upper bound)
; 132-179 168-189. Note that you don't need to set 15 as option value to display both fields correctly. As the name implies the option
; is per field, so a value of 8 can display two 8 character wide fields correctly.
ValueRangeFieldWidth=7

; Field delimiter for affix detail lines. This is put between value range fields. If this value were set to a comma, the above
; double range example would become 132-179,168-189.
AffixDetailDelimiter=" "

; If the MirrorLineFieldWidth is set to a value that is smaller than the actual length of the affix line text
; the affix line will be cut off and this text will be appended at the end to indicate tha the line was truncated.
;
; Usually this is set to the ASCII or Unicode value of the three dot ellipsis (alt code: 0133).
; Note that the correct display of text characters outside the ASCII standard depend on the file encoding and the 
; AHK version used. For best results, save this file as ANSI encoding which can be read and displayed correctly by
; either ANSI based AutoHotkey or Unicode based AutoHotkey.
;
; Example: assume the affix line to be mirrored is '+#% increased Spell Damage'.
; If the MirrorLineFieldWidth is set to 18, this field would be shown as '+#% increased Spel…'
AffixDetailEllipsis=…

[Tooltip]

; Pixels mouse must move to auto-dismiss tooltip
MouseMoveThreshold=40

; Set this to 1 if you want to have the tooltip disappear after the time frame set below.
; Otherwise you will have to move the mouse by 5 pixels for the tip to disappear.
UseTooltipTimeout=0

;How many ticks to wait before removing tooltip. 1 tick = 100ms. Example, 50 ticks = 5secends, 75 Ticks = 7.5Secends
ToolTipTimeoutTicks=150

; Font size for the tooltip, leave empty for default
FontSize=9

; Displays the tooltip in virtual screen space at fixed coordinates.
; Virtual screen space means the complete desktop frame, including any secondary monitors.
DisplayToolTipAtFixedCoords=0

; Coordinates relative to top left corner, increasing by going down and to the right.
; Only used if DisplayToolTipAtFixedCoords is 1.
