The following is a list of what has been updated, starting with 1.9.3.
Current Script Caretaker: aRTy (GitHub/PoE Account: aRTy42, Reddit: -aRTy-)

3.2.00
================================
from aRTy

* Fixed most cases where long mods with linebreaks would cause issues.
* Added Gem Quality information for the three new v3.2 gems.
* Updated Uniques according to v3.2 patch notes and preview information.
* Updated Divination Card locations with wiki information.

3.1.01
================================
from aRTy

* Updated and rewritten information for maps.
* Updated Uniques and Divination Cards with wiki information.
* NO (!) support for Elder/Shaper mods. Waiting on GGG's advanced tier info for the clipboard, for now.

3.1.00
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome

* Included updates from the TradeMacro. Most importantly the "AdditionalMacros" now have a tab in the settings menu.
* Updates for certain 3.1 content:
** All new general item mods should be included (mostly new T1 mods)
** Full support for Abyss Jewels
** NO (!) support for Elder/Shaper mods yet
** Updated Gem Quality
** Included some of the new uniques. More will follow once the wiki situation is sorted out or at least better.
** NO (!) new map/divination card info yet. Also waiting for the wiki here.

3.0.06-beta
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome

* Uncertain mods in the affix overview no longer cause multiple lines with identical entries. This happened when a hybrid mod brought multiple variants to one part/line, but the other part/line was unambiguous.
* Flat +Def on non-armour pieces (like belts) is now handled correctly.
* Fixed an issue that could cause long .ini file write time.
* Fixed a bug about mismatching data of similarly named uniques.
* Fixed the double range display for unique items. The format "(a-b) to (c-d)" was displayed as "a-c|b-d" instead of "a-b|c-d".
* Fixed the MapModCount for tier 1-5 maps with the hybrid mod "Monster Life / Stun Immune".
* Fixed a bug with GDI+ causing FPS drops even if it was disabled. Having it enabled might still cause issues for you. (by Eruyome)

3.0.05-beta
================================
from Eruyome, aRTy

* Added a fix/workaround for the new and optional GDI+ tooltip causing FPS drops.
* Fixed ItemInfo/TradeMacro currency rate fetching/parsing (and ItemInfos currency stack conversion to chaos equivalent).
* Fixed MapModWarnings not working.

3.0.04-beta
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome, dein0s, esunder

Three big new features:
1) Full rework of ItemInfo affix parsing (aRTy)
2) GDI+ display option (Eruyome and esunder)
3) Reworked .ini handling (mostly dein0s)

These changes are quite extensive and will likely bring a few bugs that were not found. This is a beta-release for that reason. Please report issues, preferably on GitHub.

### 1) ItemInfo affix parsing:
* The script handles potentially ambiguous mods completely different now. Multiple possibilities are shown when the script considers all of them fitting. This means in particular that hybrid mods are now almost fully supported. Please report items where the scripts results seem wrong. (A few cases currently remain unhandled, these will be fixed later. See the end of section 1 for details.)
* Flasks mods are supported now.
* The user settings were reworked. Most "Display" settings were removed and replaced by new ones. Tell if you miss anything.
* Ingame tooltip changes:
  * Implicit value ranges are shown now.
  * The detailed affix overview has a header now (which can be disabled in the settings).
  * Long notation of double ranges ("added damage" mods) is the default now. (settings option)
  * A new notation for "multi tier ranges" has been introduced. These are shown when multiple mods overlap in a way that makes it uncertain which tier combination was actually rolled. They show the worst case range and best case range for the roll. Contrary to "double range" mods this does not mean that you can certainly get to the top roll (via Divine Orbs), it means your actual roll range is somewhere within the displayed ranges.
  * All these notations aswell as new abbreviations get a 1 line info at the end of the tooltip when they are present.
  * The top section with basic information and DPS calculation for weapons was rearranged. It includes a warning now when a low itemlevel lowers the item's max socket number. Furthermore Q20PhysDps got added.
* Currently unhandled affix cases:
  * Weapons with #% increased Physical Damage, +# to Accuracy Rating and 5-10% increased Light Radius. (up to 4 mods mix)
  * Tower shields with #% increased Armour, #% increased Stun and Block Recovery and +#% Chance to Block. (up to 5 mods mix)

### 2) GDI+ display:
* You can enable GDI+ in the settings menu, which results in a tooltip using the GDI+ graphics library. This alternative tooltip allows colour customization and transparency.

### 3) Reworked .ini handling:
* User defined settings will now persist between new version updates (proper INI file updating instead of overwriting).
* The script should now run correctly regardless of the selected keyboard layout, previously non-latin layouts like russian caused errors related to hotkeys on script start.
* AdditionalMacros hotkeys, their states and other configurations should be changed in AdditionalMacros.ini from now on.
* AdditionalMacros.txt was moved out of the user folder and shouldn't be edited anymore. The subfolder CustomMacros with it's user created/added/edited scripts serves its old purpose from now on.
* MapModWarning states should be changed in MapModWarnings.ini.

### 4) Other notable changes:
* The changed poe.ninja API endpoint is fixed.
* New AdditionalMacros:
  * Ctrl + Alt + C opens an item on pathof.info for an advanced affix breakdown.
  * Ctrl + Alt + Enter sends "/whois <lastWhisperCharacterName>" when keys are released (not when pressed).

### 5) Minor notes and bugfixes:
* Fixed Chance To Poison / Increased Poison Damage that was swapped.
* Chance To Bleed's data file was missing a | character so a value was not read properly.
* 3.0's new increased Cast Speed mod for ES shields was missing.
* 3.0's new increased Attack Damage mod for AR/EV hybrid base shields is now correctly considered as a prefix and not a suffix.
* Adapted rewording of jewel Bleeding suffix and jewel Poison Duration suffix.
* Fixed MapModWarning for "Monsters cannot be Stunned".
* Map Info: Lair Map upgrades to Mineral Pools (not Spider Forest).
* The gem quality info for Summon Skeleton gets displayed now (by not expecting "Summon Skeletons").
* Fixed a bug with increased Elemental Damage with Attack Skills: There are two almost identical progressions, but the script only knew one. This is not a new change, but simply was never noticed. It is now correctly differentiated between 'on weapon' and 'on other item type' which shifts the T2 to T1 breakpoint from 37/38 to 36/37.

3.0.03
================================
from aRTy

Improvements for 3.0 mods: All new ailment mods should now be supported. Old Energy Shield mods should now all be fixed.
	Flat defense mods on hybrid armour bases are supported, hybrid life mods are not (if you see .5 prefixes, it's likely hybrid life).
Fixed some gem quality information and changes to gem names.
Updated Divination Cards and Uniques with data from the wiki.

3.0.02
================================
from aRTy

Updated Divination cards with data from the wiki. Note that a lot of information is still missing.
Updated and corrected Unique data from the wiki.
Added the quality information for the new 3.0 gems.
Fixed a few weapon mod matching issues. Not all new 3.0 mods are supported yet, still.
Adopted the new wording for the two map mods concerning "Elemental Ailments" (no longer "Status Ailments"). This includes rewording in the MapModWarnings.txt.

3.0.01
================================
from aRTy

Imported new unique data from the wiki.

3.0.00
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome

Reworked AdditionalMacros (by Eruyome). Refer to the ReadMe section at the start of the AdditionalMacros.txt file.
Improved several technical aspects regarding file downloads and updates (by Eruyome).
Added most unambiguous new mods and updated existing ones. NOT included: The new hybrid mods and mods that overlap (such as
	the new "increased fire/cold/lightning damage" prefix on weapons that combines with the suffix).

2.6.04
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome, Nightblade

Map parsing: MapModWarnings can now be customized. Like AdditionalMacros the file is put into the user folder and 
	can be accessed via the context menu "Edit -> Map Mod Warnings".
New feature: Item highlighting (by Nightblade & Eruyome). The AdditionalMacros now come with a function that fills the search bar at
	your stash or at vendors. While hovering over an item, use Ctrl+F for a specific or Ctrl+Alt+F for a broad search term.
	Jumping into the search bar with Ctrl+F while not hovering over an item is unaffected.
AdditionalMacros: Added more functions and enabled more functions by default.

2.6.03
================================
from aRTy

Map mod parsing improved. Includes mod warnings for unpopular or difficult mods.
Map data: Tooltip now includes "Boss Arena: Yes/No". Updated most difficulty and layout ratings with the wiki's map article.

2.6.03-beta
================================
from aRTy and Eruyome

New feature: Map affix parsing which includes mod counting, so you no longer have to guesstimate 8-mods. Since this was a big chunk of code and
	is probably not completely bug-free yet this is a beta-release. If you want to test it: Please do! (and report any oddities you find).
Included some Leaguestone fixes and further updater optimizations. (by Eruyome)
Updated Uniques and Maps with wiki info (with thanks to cirf for updating all the articles about shaped maps).

2.6.02-beta
================================
(deleted because bugged)

2.6.01
================================
from aRTy

Updated Uniques, Divination Cards and Maps with the current wiki info.
Fixed Atlas info: Grotto Map and Dungeon Map now list each other as connected. (with thanks to "paulcdejean" on GitHub)
Fixed a bug that only occured when ItemInfo was used via the TradeMacro: The predicted Q20Dps was off due to a rounding error.

2.6.00
================================
from aRTy

Updated Uniques, Divination Cards and Maps with the current wiki info.
	(Be still attentive when checking uniques since the wiki is not fully updated yet)

2.5.06
================================
from Eruyome, 4GForce, aRTy

New features: Auto-updater and global user settings. (by Eruyome)
	The update notification window now comes with a button "update". This feature allows the script to download the new files
		from GitHub and extract them to a folder of your choosing. In the right click menu "PoE Item Info Settings" you can tick
		options to skip the folder selection (and thus always using the default generic folder "POE-ItemInfo") aswell as
		not creating and asking about a backup folder (which occurs when overwriting an existing folder with the update).
		If you are not interested in keeping old versions and basically want the update with ask few clicks as possible,
		you probably want to tick both options.
	Global user settings means that the script no longer stores its config files and the AdditionalMacros file in the script folder
		itself, but instead creates and uses files at "<MyDocuments>\PoE-ItemInfo\". This means that the script will no longer
		overwrite your settings and AdditionalMacro file with the defaults with every update. By using file hashes the updater will
		detect when an update introduced changes to the defaults and only then update the user files. In that case your former
		user files will also be backed up in that case so you can easily copy modifications into the new file again if you want to.

Made several fixes and changes to pseudo-mods. (by 4GForce and Eruyome)
Added a new default command to the AdditionalMacros: Winkey+D will now minimize PoE to the taskbar. Contrary to tabbing out or similar
	commands this will make PoE stay minimized while using other windows, instead of having it pop-up again behind them.
Fixed the tiers for the flat ES mod for shields. The legacy tier "136-145" was still being used as T1, which is now fixed so
	that "107-135" is considered T1.
Made some adjustments to the handling of Implicits. (by Eruyome)
	
2.5.05
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome, 4GForce

Fixed an issue with the file encoding of the config file and adjusted the handling of it. If you had weird characters instead
	of the three dots for abbreviating mods, try this release.

2.5.04
================================
from Eruyome, aRTy, 4GForce

UPDATE YOUR AUTOHOTKEY INSTALLATION
(unless you updated in the last 2-3 months already)
http://ahkscript.org/

New feature: Currency ratios fetched from http://poe.ninja/. Using the script on currency other than chaos calculates the
	conversion of the whole stack into chaos and displays the ratio. All four leagues are displayed.
	This feature is enabled by default. The data gets refreshed when starting or reloading the script or
	when using the function while the data is older than 3 hours. (by Eruyome; special thanks also
	to poe.ninja dev rasmuskl for the API and assistance)
Added two functions to the AdditionalMacros: "setAfkMessage" and "CloseScripts" (by Eruyome).
Added missing gem quality infos (Blade Flurry, Blight, Scorching Ray, Vaal Breach).
Unknown mods and special essence mods now display that they are unknown or from essences instead of leaving a blank line. (by 4GForce)
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused pseudo mods from an earlier item to show up if the current item had none. (thanks to 4GForce)
Fixed a bug with data fetching for uniques. The last release was missing data for a few body armours and many jewels.
Fixed several errors in the data for maps about vendoring and atlas connections.
Updated Maps, Divination Cards and Uniques with the current wiki info.

2.5.03
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome
Included an update notifier for the script (by Eruyome).
Updated Maps, Divination Cards and Uniques with the current wiki info.
Included the name change of "Armory Map" to "Armoury Map" (again), because it got partially reverted with v2.5.02.

2.5.02
================================
from aRTy
Fixed a bug with added elemental damage for bows that got introduced in 2.5.01.
Moved the pause function key binding to the "AdditionalMacros" file so that people can change the key more easily.

2.5.01
================================
from aRTy
Updated maps and divination cards with wiki info.
Added gem quality info to cast while channeling.
Fixed a bug that sometimes caused item types of rares to be mismatched if their randomly assigned name contained a keyword
	for that item type.
Corrected the data for the unique "Prismatic Eclipse" that was missing two mods in the last release.

2.5.00
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome
Updated Uniques for PoE v2.5.
Uniques now only show those values on the right side that actually have a range to roll. This should simplify comparing your rolls.
The method of pulling the unique data was changed, so a few errors might have slipped in. Please report any errors you find.
Items now show pseudo mods below the affix details (by Eruyome). Update autohotkey if you get an error about a nonexisting function StrReplace (in that case your AHK installation is more than 1.5 years old).
Included the name change of the "Armory Map" to "Armoury Map".
Fixed a bug that caused item flavour text or usage hints to appear at the bottom line in some cases.

2.4.05
================================
from aRTy, Eruyome, Arkaf
Changed Direct3DWindowClass to POEWindowClass and the relevant .exe names, so that the script works again.
	It should support both standalone and steam version and both 32 and 64 bit.
Currency stacks of 1000+ in the currency tab should now read correctly for the currency conversion function.
	(thanks to Arkaf and iulianov who commented on this)

2.4.04
================================
from aRTy
Minor fix for map matching (Ivory Temple Map and Vaal Temple Map were detected as Temple Map)

2.4.03
================================
from aRTy and Eruyome
Updated Maps. Added shaped maps and included information from the wiki where possible.
Corrected the data for the "Cast Speed" affix, which is higher for staves since PoE v2.4
Fixed item type detection for magic items (by Eruyome)
Added or changed several functions and data storing methods so that the "PoE-TradeMacro" can build
	on top of this script (by Eruyome)

2.4.02
================================
from aRTy
Updated Uniques.
Maps have updated Boss descriptions, general notes and ratings for difficulty (1-5) and layout (A-C).

2.4.01
================================
from aRTy
Compiled new map info from various sources, see the forum thread for details.
Updated Divinations cards with wiki information.
Uniques not updated yet, because there are lots of things to fix and holding back
	the map update until everything is done seemed stupid.

2.4.00
================================
from aRTy
Basic support for the new value range format ("#-#" was changed to "# to #"). The script will continue to display its results as before.
Map and Divination card information was not updated yet. This will follow in a few days once there is enough on the wiki.
Fixed how the "AdditionalMacros" file was included to support shortcuts to the script from the start menu and task bar.

2.3.07
================================
from aRTy
New feature: Gem quality info. Full 20% quality effect and effect per quality point get displayed.
Completely restructured jewels: Separated both the affix parsing code and the data files.
	This change should have no visible impact ingame. Please report bugs if you notice any.
Corrected a few value ranges and detection errors for jewels. Legacy Crit Multiplier for jewels in standard did not get a special
	detection though, you will get something like "n/a (0) <new value range> T0" there.
Added Tora crafts "increased Trap and Mine damage" and "increased Trap Throwing and Mine Laying Speed"
Updated Divination Cards with wiki infos

2.3.06
================================
from aRTy
The new label "Map Drop" introduced in PoE v2.3.2 is now accounted for and thus no longer breaks parsing items.
Added new file "AdditionalMacros.txt" in the main folder. The user macros that used to be at the very end of the ahk-file
	are now located here, for easier access. Added detection for the Steam version exe-file. The user macros are disabled
	by default, if you want to learn more about them, check the opening post in the forum thread.
Removed script function "Valuable Evaluation", meaning uniques and gems are no longer tagged as "Valuable" in the
	last line, which was controlled via txt files. Lootfilters fulfill this role nowadays.
	Similarly, drop only gems are no longer tagged, also because lootfilters and since there are almost none since
	gems became available from vendors. If you miss one of these functions, please give feedback in the forum thread.
DPS display: Fixed how additional ele/chaos damage was detected. It used to break for certain mods, which made the section display blanks.
Fixed Divination Card detection that got broken with PoE v2.3.2 (the game now labels them with "Rarity: Divination Card"
	instead of "Rarity: Normal")
Fixed "Stun Recovery" that got renamed to "Stun and Block Recovery" with PoE v2.3.2.
Updated Uniques, Maps, Divination Cards with wiki infos

2.3.04
================================
from Underbent, magus424
Major update to the maps data file, thanks to yet another data script from Underbent
	This should fix incorrect map vendoring information and give more divination card drop infos.
Added Shavronne's Gambit to uniques, which was still missing (pointed out by magus424)

2.3.03
================================
from aRTy
Uniques: Included more of the new 2.3 uniques. Updated implicits for Sceptres and Wands.
	Manually adjusted the display for a few more uniques (notable: Ventor's Gamble and several Jewels)
Updated Divination Cards
Updated Maps

2.3.02
================================
from underbent, vdorie, aRTy
Improved data thanks to underbent's additions to the data fetch script: https://github.com/underbent/scrape_poe_info
	This means divination cards are now updated to today's wiki infos
	and uniques with decimal point values (like 0.2% leech) no longer truncate the displayed value to 0
Manually cleaned up the display for uniques with style variants (Doryani's Invitation, Atziri's Splendour, Vessel of Vinktar)
The modifier/text column for uniques is now 10 characters wider than for other items (if truncation is used, which is the default),
	as uniques don't need the space for displaying mod tiers but tend to have longer or more complicated wording.
Included a fix from vdorie to how the base level of blue items was determined
Included a fix from underbent so that the warning info of equipped items that you no longer meet the requirements for is not
	displayed in the info script window anymore

2.3.01
================================
from aRTy
Added "Has Fated Variant" line to info for respective uniques
"Max Sockets" should no longer show up on non armour/weapon items

Added Caer Blaidd, Wolfpack's Den
Added The Perandus Manor. Could use more detais, wiki article was rather short

2.0.12
=================================
Uniques.txt updated
Added ability to "Pause" the script. 
This allows users of other scripts
that look for the clipboard change to 
operate. Simply press the "Pause" key
to pause, and then "Pause" again to 
re-enable the script. Key can be
remapped to whatever key the user
may like in the section at the very
end of the script.

Updated Uniques.txt

2.0.1 Bug Fixes by XiMMiX
=================================
Fixed typo in FlaskChargesUsed
Fixed buugs reported by FleshRocket

2.0 Jewel Support by XiMMiX
=================================
I've added support for jewels to the script.

There is a known problem with the suffix count in those cases where we don't know if the item has 1 or 2 suffixes. At the moment the output says the item has 2 suffixes but it should be "1 or 2". But otherwise the code should work.

The second problem is that I haven't yet been able to test very much, especially the complex affixes. I'm planning to test all edge cases with complex affixes, but would appreciate any help with testing the simple affixes.
